(figure out the mask that would work to AND it with, for the sign bit you need the
32nd bit so you find the 32 bit binary number to AND it with and put it in hex)
ex: if you had 1010, you would AND it with 1000 and put it in hex, when you AND 
it then 1 AND 1 will be 1 so you'll see that it's a negative
#define SIGN_MASK         0x80000000  //extract the sign bit
#define SIGN_SHIFT        31          //number of bits to shift the sign mask
#define EXPONENT_MASK     0x7f800000  //extract exponent bit
#define EXPONENT_SHIFT    23          //number of bits to shift the exponent mask, EXPONENT_MASK minus EXPONENT_BIAS
#define EXPONENT_BIAS     127         //value of the bias which is 127
#define SIGNIFICAND_MASK  0x007fffff  //23 bits of significand, //extract the significand
